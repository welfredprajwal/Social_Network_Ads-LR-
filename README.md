# Social_Network_Ads-LR-
This project builds a Logistic Regression model to optimize ad targeting for a social media platform. Since older, wealthier users engage more with a specific ad, the model predicts user interest based on Age and Salary. By analyzing engagement patterns, it helps display ads strategically, maximizing click-through rates and improving ad efficiency.
(Logistic Regression : Logistic regression is a type of supervised learning classification algorithm that is used to predict a binary output variable)
